# LilleRShake

## Intro

This is a list of python utilities to plot data from the RaspberryShake @ Univ. Lille, France

Raspberry Shake are small and relatively cheap seismographs, easy to use, and easy to install. The Raspberry Shake can monitor activities emitting sounds and vibrations, from earthquakes to meteorites, rocket launches, tornadoes, lightning, wind farms, airplanes, trains, traffic and much much more.  Once the are plugged in, you are ready to start monitoring and connect with hundreds of others on a large Citizen powered Earth monitoring network, called Station View, and discover events from around the globe in real time.

I am a deep Earth geophysicist but not expert seismologist and use the Raspberry Shake for fun and teaching purposes at Univ. Lille, France.

 * python
 * matplotlib
 * pyQT5 GUI interface for matplotlib (you can change this at the very top of the script)
 * obspy from https://docs.obspy.org/

## Content

At present
 * Scripts to plot records from individual seismometer(s), including the RShake at Univ. Lille for one event are in [EQRecords](EQRecords/)
 * More to come soon...
